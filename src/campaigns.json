      "description": "On Tuesday April 18, 2023 my niece Kinsley white and my brother William white were both shot in an incident that was unimaginable and will forever haunt my niece. Kinsley has and will continue to go to therapy for this as well as forever have a scare to remind her of the day that could have been her last. Kinsley is one of 4 kids in the family who will be in need of therapy and who will have to do without while their dad is out of work. This go fund me is set up to assist in getting the kids the help they will need and the doctor bills that will ensue this following my brothers release. The helicopter ride alone will be a lot. He did not have insurance and will need any assistance he can get. Everything donated is appreciated and will be used towards these kids and bills. Thanks for your consideration!",
